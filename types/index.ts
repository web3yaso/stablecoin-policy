 * Where a jurisdiction stands on AI / data center DEVELOPMENT (not on

 * (favorable). Intuition checks:
 *
 *  - restrictive  — Active moratoriums or hard caps on data centers / AI.
 *                   Maine LD 307, Oregon HB 2816, EU AI Act on services.
 *  - concerning   — Real legislation moving with regulatory teeth, but
 *                   not an outright stop. China (heavy on AI services
 *                   but pro-infrastructure), Texas (incentives + grid
 *                   strain pushback), Germany (strict EnEfG energy law).
 *  - review       — Studying, hearings, non-binding frameworks, bills
 *                   filed but stalled. South Korea AI Basic Act, Canada
 *                   post-AIDA, most US states with study bills.
 *  - favorable    — Innovation-friendly: light-touch, preemption-pushing,
 *                   incentive-heavy. US federal (Trump WH framework),
 *                   UK (principles-based), France (sovereign AI push),
 *                   Japan (voluntary framework), Tennessee, etc.
 *  - none         — No major activity tracked.
