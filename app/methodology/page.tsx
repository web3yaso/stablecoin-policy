          <p>
            Every bill on the site comes from official legislative tracking
            sites — state legislature portals, congress.gov, the EU&rsquo;s
            eur-lex, and equivalent sources in each jurisdiction we cover.
            We re-check each active bill weekly for stage changes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each bill is coded against a set of{" "}
            <strong className="text-ink font-semibold">impact tags</strong> —
            grid capacity, water consumption, carbon emissions, local control,
            and so on — drawn from its summary, committee testimony, and bill
            text. Tags are assigned by hand; we don&rsquo;t use automated
            sentiment analysis because policy nuance doesn&rsquo;t survive it.
          </p>
          <p>
            The{" "}
            <strong className="text-ink font-semibold">stance</strong> of a
            jurisdiction — restricting, cautionary, under review, encouraging,
            or no activity — is a judgment call based on the direction and
            weight of its active legislation, not a score. A state with one
            enacted moratorium weighs more than a state with five filed
            study bills.
          </p>
          <p>
            When a bill has no clear impact, we leave the tag list empty
            rather than forcing it into a bucket. When a jurisdiction has
            contradictory bills — one moratorium and one incentive — we
            flag it as <em>cautionary</em> rather than picking a side.
